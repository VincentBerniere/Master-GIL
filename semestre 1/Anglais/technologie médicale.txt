imagery
This is all the anatomical and functional imaging technology, cellular and molecular.

drugs
The emergence of new drugs result of a long and costly process. It begins with the screening of thousands of molecules to be completed by any marketing.

biotechnology and bioengineering
This area covers all diagnostic technologies and analysis, their implantation in the living and biomaterials related to regenerative medicine and bio-production.

surgery and interventional techniques
Surgical technologies include many methods and knowledge that the fundamental issue is to minimize the risk of complications for the patient and reduce the response time as hospitalization.
